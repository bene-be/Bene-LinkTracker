WHAT IS IT?

Bene LinkTracker is a small ExpressionEngine 2 plugin that simplifies the process of turning links into Google Analytics traceable events.  

HOW TO USE?

1. Use the latest Google Analytics javascript
-----------------------------------------------------
First of all make sure you use the latest version of the Google Analytics tracking javascript that allows asynchronic event tracking, for more details see:
http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/asyncTracking.html
You can easily find the code required for your website in your Google Analytics profile.  Remember that you should place the javascript on every page that
needs to track events.  It should be positioned just before the closing </head> - tag

Please note that Google Analytics tracks about 500 events per session, so if users generate more events you track than they get ignored

2. Tag your links so they get tracked as events
-----------------------------------------------------
This add-ons is here to help you with creating more complex HTML links tags without having to deal with the complexity of it.  Features that are supported:
- Standard Parameters
    - url = the url to link to
    - target = the target of the link (values: blank, parent, self, top or [framename])
    - text = the name of the link
    - title = the title of the link (shown on hover over)
- Google Analytics Goal tracking:
    - track = (default is "yes").  If parameter not explicitely set to "No", Google Analytics code will be added to track the click on this link as goal,
                    url of the link will be used as name of the goal.
    - label = Optionally you can specify a label of the event that needs to appear e.g. label='Click on www.expressionengine.com link'.  If not set a standard set of rules will be used
                    to determine the label. The logic has the ability to differentiate link to own site, links to external site, links to email and others


3. View your reports in your Google Analytics account
-----------------------------------------------------
After a day of usage you can track the results in your Google Analytics account under 'Content' > 'Events'

EXAMPLE:

{exp:bene_linktracker url="http://www.bene.be" target='_blank' track='yes' text='Visit us' title="Go to our website"}
